Created two bash scripts to help with version control of configuration files

bash addDotfiles.sh will push .bashrc .bash_aliases and .vimrc from ~/ folder to the github repository.

bash getDotfiles.sh will pull from the github repository and replace .bashrc .bash_aliases and .vimrc in the ~/ directory with the files from the github repository
